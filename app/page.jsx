        <h1>Code Examples and Guides on Functionality with Alpine JS</h1>

        <p>
          Alpine JS allows you to write DOM manipulation all in your HTML, Liquid, Blade etc. This
          website serves as a collection of examples of functionality that you may have to build in
          your next project.
        </p>

        <p>I have kept the styling to a minimum so that you can focus on the functionality.</p>
